# Privacy and Security Readiness

Lost to Found Records handles custody, parenting-time, child support, court, school, health-adjacent, financial, and evidence records. Treat production data as highly sensitive even when it is not regulated as medical, financial, or child-directed data.

## Target Baseline

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
- NIST Privacy Framework 1.0: privacy risk management, data processing awareness, and individual privacy protection.
- OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 Level 2 for application security verification.
- CIS Controls v8.1 Implementation Group 1 as minimum operational hygiene, with IG2 controls where practical.
- FTC data security principles: know what is collected, keep only what is needed, protect it, dispose of it safely, and plan for incidents.

## Production Launch Gates

These gates are enforced by `src/lib/production/readiness.ts` and `scripts/check-production-readiness.mjs` where they can be represented as deployment configuration. The same status is visible in the app at `/launch-readiness`, and `/launch-wizard` separates pre-Supabase work from the final Supabase live-data step.

## Privacy Commitments

- Do not collect child accounts or child login credentials.
- Do not add public profiles, co-parent messaging, advertising trackers, or third-party session replay.
- Keep user-entered labels privacy-friendly by default; encourage labels like `Child 1` and `Parent B`.
- Avoid collecting Social Security numbers, full bank account numbers, card numbers, unrelated third-party information, and unnecessary medical detail.
- Evidence files stay private, are scanned before storage, and are downloaded only through authenticated server routes.
- Reports must not include raw storage paths, hashes, service URLs, or internal identifiers that are not needed by the user.

## Operational Runbooks Required Before Launch

- Backup and restore: document backup cadence, encryption, access, restore owner, restore test evidence, and backup aging after deletion.
- Deletion and export: use `DATA_RETENTION_DELETION_RUNBOOK.md` to document how users request export/deletion, what is deleted immediately, what remains in backups, and how long backups age out.
- Incident response: use `INCIDENT_RESPONSE_RUNBOOK.md` for severity levels, containment steps, contact owner, user notification decision process, evidence preservation, and post-incident review.
- Monitoring and alerting: use `MONITORING_ALERTING_RUNBOOK.md` for alert sources, thresholds, escalation channels, log minimization rules, and review cadence.
- Access review: document who has Supabase, hosting, domain, deployment, monitoring, and malware-scanner access; review before launch and at least quarterly.
- Vendor review: document Supabase, hosting/CDN, malware scanner, email provider, logging/monitoring, and DNS registrar security posture.
- Edge security: use `EDGE_SECURITY_RULES.md` before setting the WAF and rate-limit readiness flags.
- Legal review: use `LEGAL_REVIEW_PACKET.md` before setting `LEGAL_REVIEW_APPROVED=true`.

## Two-User Isolation Test

Before setting `TWO_USER_ISOLATION_TESTED_AT`, verify with two real Supabase Auth test users:

1. User A creates a records dataset and uploads a clean synthetic evidence file.
2. User B cannot load User A's dataset through `/api/records/dataset`.
3. User B cannot download or delete User A's evidence through evidence routes, even if User B submits copied metadata.
4. User A can still load, download, and delete their own synthetic evidence.
5. Supabase storage contains no public evidence object URLs.
6. Logs do not include note bodies, evidence file contents, payment references, or raw storage paths.

Use synthetic records only. Do not test with real custody, child, court, health, school, financial, or evidence material.

An executable verifier is available:

```bash
npm run verify:isolation
```

Set `RECORDS_APP_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `RECORDS_EVIDENCE_BUCKET` before running it against staging or production. See `SUPABASE_LIVE_VERIFICATION.md` for the latest live-project notes.

## Operational Verification Commands

Run these with synthetic data only:

```bash
npm run verify:env-template
npm run verify:headers
npm run check:pre-supabase
npm run verify:malware
npm run verify:isolation
npm run verify:supabase-auth
npm run verify:security-events
npm run verify:backup-restore
npm run check:live
```
