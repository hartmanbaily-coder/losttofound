# Legal Review Packet

Review date target: before accepting real custody, parenting-time, child support, payment, court, school, health-adjacent, or evidence records.

This packet is not legal advice. It packages the current product materials for qualified counsel or an authorized reviewer.

## Product Scope To Review

My Custody Case is a privacy-first records workspace for parents or guardians to organize:

- custody and parenting-time schedules
- exchange logs and issues
- child support orders and payment records
- shared expenses and reimbursement tracking
- private evidence files
- notes and incident timelines
- court-packet-oriented reports and exports

The MVP does not provide legal advice, does not decide court strategy, does not guarantee admissibility, and does not create child accounts.

## Product Wording To Approve

Approve or revise these positions before `LEGAL_REVIEW_APPROVED=true` is set:

- The app helps organize records and does not provide legal advice.
- Users remain responsible for deciding what to file, share, or present in court.
- Generated reports and timelines are organizational tools, not legal findings.
- Evidence uploads may be rejected or blocked by malware scanning.
- Deleted data may remain in encrypted backups until backup retention expires.
- Users should avoid entering unnecessary real child names, full account numbers, or unrelated third-party details.

- reviewer name or role
