# Deployment Notes

## Domains

Production domain: `losttofound.org`

Suggested staging subdomain: `staging-losttofound.org`

## HTTPS

HTTPS is required before production use. Do not serve authenticated pages, evidence downloads, or generated reports over plain HTTP.

Enable HSTS only after HTTPS is verified end-to-end. The app currently sends:

```text
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

Review whether `includeSubDomains` and `preload` are appropriate for all `losttofound.org` subdomains before final production launch.

## DNS Setup

- Point `losttofound.org` only to the active hosting provider.
- Verify ownership in the hosting provider dashboard.
- Use a separate staging host for staging.
- Avoid sharing auth cookies across sibling subdomains.
- Remove stale CNAME, A, AAAA, or provider verification records immediately when changing hosting providers.

Dangling DNS records can create subdomain takeover risk.

## Cookies

Production auth cookies must be:

- Host-only for `losttofound.org`
- Not scoped to `.losttofound.org`
- Secure
- HttpOnly
- SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Strict
- Preferably `__Host-` prefixed where compatible

## Environment Variables

Use deployment platform secret storage. Do not commit:

- Database URLs with credentials
- Auth secrets
- Supabase service role keys
- Storage credentials
- Email provider secrets
- Malware scanning credentials
- Production tokens

Rotate exposed credentials immediately.

Production for `losttofound.org` runs on a dedicated Ubuntu host under the non-root `losttofound` account. Its rootless Docker daemon owns only the LostToFound, ClamAV, and Caddy containers. The Listhaus repository, host, secrets, Compose project, and deployment workflow are not part of this deployment boundary.

Use this deploy path for LostToFound changes:

1. Commit and push the LostToFound change to `hartmanbaily-coder/losttofound` `main`.
2. Confirm that the `Validate LostToFound` workflow passes lint, typecheck, unit tests, secret scanning, production env template validation, dependency audit, and build.
3. From a trusted administrator Mac with the pinned SSH host key at `~/.ssh/losttofound_known_hosts`, run `deploy/production/deploy-from-mac.sh <host> <validated-commit-sha>`.
4. The remote deploy builds a release-tagged image, starts the isolated stack, verifies readiness, verifies clean/EICAR malware scanning, verifies security headers, and rolls back to the prior image if validation fails.
5. Verify production after deploy:
   - `https://losttofound.org/records` serves the expected bundle/UI.
   - A fake login to `POST https://losttofound.org/api/records/auth/login` returns a handled `400` or `401` JSON response, not a blank `500`.
   - `https://losttofound.org/api/records/readiness` returns a structured `ready` or `not_ready` result with no unexpected infrastructure blocker. Policy and dashboard attestations remain visible and must not be marked complete without evidence.

Production deployment is intentionally not triggered by GitHub Actions. This keeps the production SSH key and host environment out of GitHub and removes the cross-repository `LISTHAUS_DEPLOY_TOKEN`. Run `npm run check:production` with the real host environment before accepting real records.

The dedicated host is bootstrapped once with `deploy/production/bootstrap-host.sh`. The host must use key-only SSH, disabled root login, UFW, fail2ban, unattended security updates, rootless Docker, at least 8 GiB of RAM, and `/srv/losttofound/config/app.env` owned by `losttofound:losttofound` with mode `0600`. The config directory is separate from the rsynced application tree and is never stored in GitHub. ClamAV receives a 4 GiB limit so daily signature reloads do not kill `clamd`; the rootless `losttofound-health-watchdog.timer` restarts an unhealthy or missing scanner and reruns the clean/EICAR verification without exposing the Docker socket to another container.

When Supabase is intentionally saved for last, run `npm run check:pre-supabase` first. That mode still checks host, secret strength, edge controls, monitoring, malware scanning, privacy/legal approvals, and other non-Supabase gates, while deferring the final Supabase Auth, storage, restore, and isolation checks.

Set `EXPECTED_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=cieuilbpnwuvnrxrlczj` in production. The readiness check rejects the older staging/mixed-use Supabase project so records traffic cannot accidentally launch against `adhnoiicwfvppzenwcgv`.

Run `npm run verify:env-template` before deploy to confirm the committed production template still points at `losttofound.org` and the clean records Supabase project without containing real secrets.

Run `npm run verify:headers` against the local or deployed app to confirm CSP, HSTS, frame blocking, referrer policy, content-type sniffing protection, and browser permissions policy are present. Non-local production URLs must use HTTPS.

Run `npm run verify:malware` against the real production scanner before setting `MALWARE_SCANNER_TESTED_AT`. The live deployment verified the internal ClamAV scanner on 2026-06-28 with clean and EICAR payloads. Run `npm run check:live` against the deployed HTTPS app before pointing production traffic at it.

Run `npm run verify:security-events` after configuring `SECURITY_EVENT_SINK`. For webhook sinks, the script sends a synthetic sanitized event and requires a successful HTTPS response. For platform/SIEM sinks, confirm the emitted event appears in the monitoring tool before marking monitoring complete.

Run a backup restore drill, save the non-sensitive evidence artifact at ignored path `ops/backup-restore-evidence.json`, and run `npm run verify:backup-restore` before setting `BACKUP_RESTORE_TESTED_AT`.

For production records, both storage mode variables must be set to `supabase`. Local/demo mode is intentionally blocked by the production readiness check.

Do not enable `RECORDS_ALLOW_BEARER_AUTH` in production. Records API authentication should use the server-managed HttpOnly cookies set by `/api/records/auth/login`.

## Database and Backups

Production data should use encrypted database connections, encryption at rest, encrypted backups, protected backup access, retention limits, and restoration testing.

Document the deletion process and how backups age out after account or case deletion.

The production Supabase/Postgres schema is in `database/supabase/production_schema.sql` and has been applied to production project `cieuilbpnwuvnrxrlczj` (`losttofound-records-production`) at `https://cieuilbpnwuvnrxrlczj.supabase.co`.

Applied production records migration:

- `20260617182822_create_records_production_schema`

The older Supabase project `adhnoiicwfvppzenwcgv` remains staging/mixed-use. It has these records migrations, but its legacy lost-pet public tables and public bucket mean it should not be used for records production traffic:

- `20260616005239_create_records_production_schema`
- `20260616005410_harden_records_direct_table_access`
- `20260616005828_tune_records_indexes_and_profile_policies`

The records tables are intentionally server-mediated: do not grant direct `anon` or `authenticated` table access unless a browser-side data path is separately designed and reviewed. Before production launch, verify RLS/storage behavior with two different authenticated test users and confirm backup restore procedures.

See `PRIVACY_SECURITY_READINESS.md` for the required two-user isolation test and privacy/security launch gates. See `SUPABASE_LIVE_VERIFICATION.md` for the latest live Supabase project notes and `npm run verify:isolation` usage.
See `DATA_RETENTION_DELETION_RUNBOOK.md` for the deletion, retention, backup-aging, and legal-hold model to finalize before accepting real records.
See `EDGE_SECURITY_RULES.md` for WAF and rate-limit targets.

## Object Storage

Evidence storage must be private:

- No public buckets
- No anonymous share links
- Authenticated server-mediated upload, download, and delete only
- Malware scanning before storage
- No raw storage paths in logs, reports, or client-visible URLs

The current app stores evidence files only through authenticated server routes. Uploads are validated, scanned, hashed, and then written to the private `records-evidence` bucket under an authenticated user/case path. Downloads stream through the app route after ownership and clean-scan checks; raw Supabase object URLs are not exposed to the browser.

## Logging

Do not log sensitive custody, child support, court, child, health, school, payment, note, evidence, file, agency, or reference details.

Email subjects and bodies must be generic.
