# Lost to Found Records

Lost to Found Records is a privacy-first MVP for custody, parenting-time, child support, expense, evidence, and family-court documentation workflows.

Production domain: `losttofound.org`

The product is for factual documentation and organization only. It does not provide legal advice, predict court outcomes, or claim that any record is legally established.

## MVP Status

This repository now ships a working records workspace with synthetic demo data by default and an optional Supabase-backed records mode:

- Adult-user login/register demo flow
- Custody matter setup
- Simple recurring exchange rules
- Exchange logging and late/early/missed calculations
- Monthly calendar, list view, timeline, and day detail
- Date-based notes with categories, tags, and report inclusion
- Evidence records with file allow-list validation and server-mediated private upload/download/delete in Supabase mode
- Child support orders and payment records
- Expense and reimbursement tracking
- Dashboard charts with Recharts
- CSV, JSON, and browser print-to-PDF report flows
- Local audit entries that avoid note bodies, court details, file contents, and payment reference values
- Security headers in `next.config.ts`
- Focused Vitest unit tests and a Playwright smoke test

Important: local mode is a browser demo store. Do not enter real custody, child, court, school, health, payment, or evidence details until production auth settings, server-side authorization, private storage isolation, malware scanning, backups, and deletion controls are configured and reviewed in the deployment environment.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zod
- Recharts
- Supabase Auth, private Storage, and server-mediated records APIs for production preparation
- Vitest
- Playwright

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The demo login is pre-filled. It only validates adult-use confirmation, email shape, and an 8-character password locally.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example`.

Real secrets belong in `.env.local` or the deployment platform secret store. Do not commit production credentials, service-role keys, API keys, private files, real user data, or evidence files.

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
npm run check:production
npm run verify:malware
npm run check:live
npm run verify:isolation
```

Playwright may require browser installation on a fresh machine:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Production Notes

Before storing real user records, verify the production deployment end to end:

- Supabase Auth settings, MFA/session policy, and rate limits
- Records API AAL2 enforcement with TOTP MFA verification in Supabase mode
- PostgreSQL tables with row-level access controls and server-enforced `userId` and `caseId` authorization
- Private object storage isolation for evidence
- Authenticated server-mediated evidence access only
- Malware scanning before evidence is stored or downloaded
- Malware scanner clean/EICAR verification with `npm run verify:malware`
- Encrypted database connections, encrypted backups, and protected backup access
- Data export and deletion workflows
- Monitoring/alerting, incident response, deletion, retention, and backup-aging runbooks
- Server-side audit logs
- Rate limits on auth and write-heavy routes
- Deployed readiness verification with `npm run check:live`
