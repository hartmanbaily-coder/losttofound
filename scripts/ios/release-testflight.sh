Usage: npm run ios:testflight [-- --dry-run]

Creates a Release archive and uploads it to App Store Connect for TestFlight.

The command only runs from a clean checkout at exactly origin/main. It uses
automatic signing from the Apple account signed in to Xcode and lets Xcode
choose the next unused build number during upload.

Options:
  --dry-run  Verify the release checkout and Xcode configuration without
             archiving or uploading.
